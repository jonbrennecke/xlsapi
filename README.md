A series of C++ classes to facilitate creation of *.xls files

# TODO: 
- create a series of Python wrappers for the C++ classes and begin using Python as the main scripting lanuage instead of Matlab. Matlab MEX integration is buggy and inconsistent between CPU architectures (x86_64 support is really limitted) and error reporting/debugging in the Matlab console is nearly nonexistent for MEX files. For a plug and play scripting interface, Python seems like the best option.
- polish off the Matlab wrappers
